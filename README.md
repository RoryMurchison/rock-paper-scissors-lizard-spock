# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock takes the classic game we all know and throws in 2 extra elements that are playable. These 2 items, Lizard and Spock, are taken from the popular TV show, The Big Bang Theory. With the inclusion of these extra variables, all elements can beat 2 others and be beaten by 2 others, ensuring the game remains balanced and a winner is found unles the same item is thrown. Playing against the computer guarentees a truly random response making the game complete luck as opposed to in person where some may argue there are elements of skill.

This simple game is targeted towards all ages, who may want a random decison made, learn the rules of this variation, test their luck on a win streak or someone who is simply bored and looking to pass the time!

### Features Left to Implement

    - One feature to implement in the future would be to add a feature where you could play first to a certain score.
